## Easier Console Utilities in .NET Core

If you typically work with web applications in .NET core, you've no doubt grown used to the many helpful features provided in this ecosystem. Tools like configuration, logging, and dependency injection are all included in the web application template. Libraries that we create for these applications are likely to rely on some or all of these features.

The standard .NET Core console application template does not include any of these tools, making it challenging to reuse libraries created for our other applications. While it's possible to manually implement all of these features, a few simple techniques can make it much easier to use them in our console utilities.
